"""
The dataset (games.csv) is from BoardGameGeek(https://www.boardgamegeek.com/), and contains data on 80000 board games.  

The dataset contains several data points about each board game. Here's a list of the interesting ones:  
* name -- name of the board game.  
* playingtime -- the playing time (given by the manufacturer).  
* minplaytime -- the minimum playing time (given by the manufacturer).  
* maxplaytime -- the maximum playing time (given by the manufacturer).  
* minage -- the minimum recommended age to play.  
* users_rated -- the number of users who rated the game.  
* average_rating -- the average rating given to the game by users. (0-10)  
* total_weights -- Number of weights given by users. Weight is a subjective measure that is made up by BoardGameGeek. It's how "deep" or involved a game is.  

ml.py script does the following things on this data:  
* Read the data using Pandas.  
* Plot our target variables to identify noise and accordingly clean our data.  
* Find correlation of other columns wrt the target column.  
* Pick predictor columns (FEATURES) from above correlation.  
* Split data into train and test set.  
* Predict target value using a regression algorithm.  
* And finally compute the error between actual values and the predicted values.

#Are there truly so many terrible games that were given a 0 rating? 
#Or is something else happening? We'll need to dive into the data bit more to check on this.

print(games[games["average_rating"] > 0].iloc[0])

#This shows us that the main difference between a game with a 0 rating and a game with a rating above 0 is that the 0 rated game has no reviews. 
#The users_rated column is 0. By filtering out any board games with 0 reviews, we can remove much of the noise.

# Remove any rows without user reviews.
games = games[games["users_rated"] > 0]
# Remove any rows with missing values. As most ML algos don't work on missing values
games = games.dropna(axis=0) #axis= 0 means rows. Here we delete rows, that have some column values as NaN.

#You can furhter cluster your data for analysing your data further (k-means clustering has been used below)

#Currently data has many columns, so we need to reduce the dimensionality of our data wihtout loosing too much information
#Using PCA: principal component analysis, we reduce data to 2 columns and then plot it

# Create a PCA model with 2 columns

#The plot shows us that there are 5 distinct clusters. 
#We could dive more into which games are in each cluster to learn more about what factors cause games to be clustered.

#Now that we want to predict average_rating, let's see what columns might be interesting for our prediction. 
#One way is to find the correlation between average_rating and each of the other columns. 

print(games.corr()["average_rating"])
#We see that the average_weight and id columns correlate best to rating. ids are presumably assigned when the game is added to the database, 
#so this likely indicates that games created later score higher in the ratings. 
#Maybe reviewers were not as nice in the early days of BoardGameGeek, or older games were of lower quality.

#Picking predictor columns (also known as "features"):
#We'll want to remove certain columns that aren't numeric. 
#We'll also want to remove columns that can only be computed if you already know the average rating. 
#Including these columns will destroy the purpose of the classifier, which is to predict the rating without
# any previous knowledge. Using columns that can only be computed with knowledge of the target can lead to OVERFITTING, 
# where your model is good in a training set, but doesn't generalize well to future data.
#The bayes_average_rating column appears to be derived from average_rating in some way, so let's remove it.

# Get all the columns from the dataframe.
columns = games.columns.tolist()
# Filter the columns to remove ones we don't want.
columns = [c for c in columns if c not in ["bayes_average_rating", "average_rating", "type", "name"]]

# Store the variable we'll be predicting on.

#Splitting into train and test sets
#If your error looks surprisingly low when you're training a machine learning algorithm, you should always check to see if you're overfitting.
#In order to prevent overfitting, we'll train our algorithm on a set consisting of 80% of the data, and test it on another set consisting of 20% of the data.

# Generate the training set. Set random_state to be able to replicate results.
train = games.sample(frac=0.8, random_state=1)

#Fitting a linear regression:::
#Linear regression is a powerful and commonly used machine learning algorithm. 
#It predicts the target variable using linear combinations of the predictor variables. 
#Let's say we have a 2 values: x and y. A linear combination would be ax+by.
#A linear combination involves multiplying each number by a constant, and adding the results.

#Linear regression works well only when the predictor variables and the target variable are linearly correlated.
# For other scnearios, some other algorithm like Random forest can be used.

# Initialize the model class.
model = LinearRegression()
# Fit the model to the training data.
model.fit(train[columns], train[target])

# Generate our predictions for the test set.
predictions = model.predict(test[columns])
